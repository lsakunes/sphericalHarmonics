<h1>Spherical Harmonics</h1>
I love physics and I love Vulkan, so I created this visualization of Spherical Harmonics based on Richard's <i>The Hydrogen Atom, Part 2 of 3: Solving the Schrodinger Equation</i>. I didn't like the way his spherical harmonics used saturation rather than radius, so I decided to make it myself.
The equations are hardcoded in shaders/simple_shader.vert.
